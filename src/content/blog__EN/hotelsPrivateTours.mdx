Here is a list of our favourite 10 best hotels in Iceland. There are obviously manu more options in Iceland in general, and in Reykjavík in particular. Whether you are looking for more budget friendly options or, on the contrary more luxurious ones. These hotels are the hotels we use by default when designing a [custom made private tour](/multiday/) for our clients. We are used to work with them, and without any specific insights from our clients on what hotel to choose, they are our first go-to. They all are very comfortable, high-end, yet not the most luxurious ones, especially in Reykjavík.Those hotels have been satisfying our clients for years now, but if you want a private tour and want to stay in a specific hotel, do not be shy to ask! We will always tailor your trip the way you want.
