**Can you see real molten lava during your stay in Iceland?** This is a question our guests ask often. While Iceland is among the most volcanically active regions on Earth, witnessing an erupting volcano and flowing lava isn’t always guaranteed. However, since 2021, a new and powerful volcanic cycle began on the Reykjanes Peninsula, prompting a surge in interest. In this article, we guide you through the most exclusive and awe-inspiring ways to see real lava in Iceland.

## The ongoing volcanic activity on the Reykjanes Peninsula

Since early 2021, the Reykjanes Peninsula—nestled between Keflavík International Airport and the capital Reykjavík—has entered a new eruptive phase. Here’s what you need to know about this dynamic volcanic region:

- Iceland remains perfectly safe for travel, even during eruptions
- Life continues seamlessly, with no disruption to flights or major services
- Eruption zones are limited in scope and closely monitored

### The "tourist eruptions" of Fagradalsfjall: 2021, 2022, and 2023

In 2021, just as the world emerged from the pandemic, the Fagradalsfjall volcano roared to life a mere 40 kilometers from Reykjavík. Images of glowing lava and adventurous travelers circled the globe. This eruption, which lasted six months, was widely referred to as a “tourist eruption”—a rare opportunity where witnessing an active volcano was both safe and accessible.

Of course, precautions are essential. If you're planning to view an erupting volcano, follow these golden rules:

- Be physically prepared for a moderately challenging hike
- Carry essentials like water, snacks, durable footwear, and warm clothing
- Always check local forecasts and respect safety closures
- Never walk on any lava—whether red-hot or solidified

Since that initial eruption, two more have occurred in the same volcanic system. In August 2022, a shorter eruption required a longer hike, lasting just three weeks. In July 2023, another brief yet spectacular eruption required a 20 km round trip hike. It marked the end of the easily accessible “tourist eruptions” in the Reykjanes area.

### The closed eruptions near Grindavík and the Blue Lagoon

From late 2023 through early 2025, a new eruptive cycle began on the Reykjanes Peninsula—this time closer to infrastructure and residential zones. Between November 2023 and May 2025, eight eruptions occurred, some lasting mere hours.

These were not safe or visitable events. Originating from the Sundhnúkur crater row, these eruptions unfolded dangerously close to essential sites like the Svartsengi Geothermal Power Plant, the Blue Lagoon, and the town of Grindavík.

Tragically, Grindavík—once home to 4,000 residents—was permanently evacuated due to pre-eruption seismic activity that severely damaged roads and homes. As a result, the Icelandic government built protective barriers and officially closed all access to the eruption sites. Out of both safety and respect, these zones remain strictly off-limits.

Our [private tours of the Reykjanes Peninsula](/day-tours-iceland/private-tour-reykjanes-peninsula-iceland/) remain open, with itineraries subject to change for safety.

## How to see real lava if the eruption sites are closed?

Even when lava isn’t safely accessible on foot, you still have two premium options for experiencing the raw beauty of molten lava in Iceland.

### A guaranteed encounter with molten lava: The Lava Show

If seeing glowing lava is on your bucket list, **The Lava Show** is an unmissable experience. In a controlled, indoor environment, lava rocks are melted and poured out right in front of you—creating a breathtaking and educational moment.

As the room fills with heat and the molten lava flows, an expert guide shares captivating stories and scientific insights about Iceland’s volcanic history. It’s the only place in the world offering such an immersive and safe encounter with real lava.

You can attend The Lava Show in two stunning locations:

- [The Lava Show in Reykjavík](/things-to-do-iceland/the-lava-show-reykjavik/)
- [The Lava Show in Vík](/things-to-do-iceland/the-lava-show-in-vik/), which is included in our [South Coast and Volcano Tales private tour](/day-tours-iceland/private-south-coast-tour-lava-center-and-lava-show/)

### Soar above erupting volcanoes with a helicopter tour

If you’re seeking an elite and dramatic perspective, take to the skies. An [aerial helicopter tour over recent eruption sites](/things-to-do-iceland/helicopter-tour-above-erupting-volcano/) offers an unforgettable way to witness an erupting volcano—or its aftermath.

While eruptions can’t be guaranteed, the flights are strategically timed and adjusted to increase your chances. And even in the absence of flowing lava, these flights pass over still-warm lava fields that can steam and smoke decades after cooling. From above, the scale, beauty, and power of Iceland’s volcanic landscape are nothing short of mesmerizing.
