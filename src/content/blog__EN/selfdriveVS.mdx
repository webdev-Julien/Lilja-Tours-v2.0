In this article, we are going to detail what are the pros and cons of a Self Drive Tour versus a Small Group Tour vs a Private Tour. As we specialise in private tours, one might say that we are a little bit biased. Even if this is true, we will try and accurately list the perks of every way to travel in Iceland.

## Self Drive Tour: The most popular

If you look at the statistics, most of the tourists coming to Iceland choose to rent a car and discover the country on their own. This type of adventure allows you to travel at your own rythm, to be free to explore as you wish and immerse yourself in nature. It requires a lot of planning in advance, that can be overwhelming for some but exciting for others.

This is a rather easy way to travel from June to October. Other than that, it is absolutely primordial to be familiar with winter driving conditions. But most importantly, when you are making your plans, you need to plan some flexibility. Icelandic weather in winter can be treacherous, roads can close with no warning, and the strong wind gusts can blow your car off the road in a blink of an eye. 

Never ever take the road without first checking the three following sites:
- <a href="https://www.vedur.is" title="icelandic weather office">vedur.is</a> for the weather.
-  <a href="https://www.safetravel.is" title="Search and Rescue Website">safetravel.is</a> to be aware of all the alerts, and get a lot of overall travel safety tips.
-  <a href="https://www.road.is" title="road administration website">road.is</a> to know the road conditions in real time.

We even reccommend that you familiarise yourself with these websites prior to your trip.

Never underestimate the weather alerts, never go on a closed road and have a safe trip!

### Pros and Cons of a Self Drive Tour in Iceland

- #### Pros
- ✅ Cost effective
- ✅ Complete freedom
- ✅ Privacy

- #### Cons
- ❌ You do not get the insights of a guide (history, geology ...)
- ❌ Weather and road conditions can lead to bad adventures
- ❌ Rescheduling because of the conditions can get costly and complicated

## Small Group Tour: Easy, Safe and informative

First of all, let's define what is a small group tour. A small group tour is a guided tour, where you share your adventure with other people and everything is planned in advance and taken care of. You do not have to drive, and you get plethora of information. In Iceland, we call a small group a group of a maximum of 19 people. Typically, the vehicles used for these tours are Mercedes Sprinters. Note that tours is bigger group (up to 60 people) also exist, and they have sensibly the same perks and disavantages, except that they are also cheaper.

For those who do not feel like driving, and want to immerse themselves in the local culture, understand the features of the incredible Icelandic nature, without putting the price of a private tour, small group tours are the way to go. 

This solution also ensures your safety as your driver-guide is responsible for checking the weather and road conditions, and determine what is doable on the day. This is a hassle-free way to travel, but it doesn’t offer the same freedom as a self-drive tour or a private tour.

### Pros and Cons of a Small group tour in Iceland

- #### Pros

## Private Tours: The best of both worlds

What are private tours? Private tours are tours where you do not travel with anybody else than your own party. You have a dedicated driver-guide, who is taking care of you and only you. These tours usually have a fixed price for the whole group, and doesn’t vary depending on the size of your group.

Private tours offer you both flexibility, freedom and a safe trip. Everything is being taken care for you in advance: planning, bookings etc ... But most importantly, the tour is personalised. So we do exactly what you want, you do not have to drive, and you get to ask your guide absolutely everything you want to know about Iceland.

The tour goes your way. Your guide will sometimes provide you with different options to choose from, and youo decide what to do. If you want to stay longer on a site that speaks to you, or less time in another less of your liking, this is no problem. We will adapt to your needs and desires.

We offer a broad selection of <a href="/all-day-tours/" title="private day tours">private day tours</a>, easy to book, with a predetermined itinerary, yet always customisable at will.

## Conclusion: Why are private tours the best?

Private tours are the best for all the reasons that we just mention. You have the flexibility and freedom of a self-drive tour, with all the guidance of a group tour. Our private tours have proven to be exceptionnal experiences to our clients since 2021, and they have been praising our services with <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189970-d24131838-Reviews-Lilja_Tours_ehf-Reykjavik_Capital_Region.html" title="Reviews">stellar reviews</a>.

The private tours are personalised and designed just for you, to ensure you the best possible experience in Iceland.

### What about the budget?

Yes, private tours can be much more expensive than group tours. You have to pay for the guide and his/her accommodation, and if there are only two of you, the cost per person can be steep. 

But, if you are traveling as a family of 5 or 6 for example, those costs will then be divided between all of you. You will quickly realise that the price will then be nearing the one of a small group tour. And you will get to travel privately with your family.
