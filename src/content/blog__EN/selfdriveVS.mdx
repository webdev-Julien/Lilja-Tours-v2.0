## Self Drive Tour: The Most Popular Way to Explore

Among all travel styles, **self drive tours in Iceland** remain the most popular. Renting a car offers complete independence: you dictate the pace, dive deep into nature, and carve your own path. It’s a rewarding approach for confident travelers who enjoy flexibility and don’t mind the extra planning.

From June to October, self-drive itineraries are relatively straightforward. Outside those months, however, Iceland’s dramatic weather becomes a significant factor. Familiarity with winter driving is crucial, as road conditions can change without warning and strong wind gusts can make driving dangerous.

Before heading out, always check:

- [vedur.is](https://www.vedur.is) – for up-to-date weather forecasts
- [safetravel.is](https://www.safetravel.is) – for safety alerts and travel tips
- [road.is](https://www.road.is) – for live road condition updates

We highly recommend exploring these resources even before arriving in Iceland. Respect weather warnings, avoid closed roads, and prioritize safety.

If self-drive is your preferred style, explore our guide to [visiting Iceland on your own](https://www.lilja-tours.com/things-to-do-in-iceland/).

## Small Group Tour: Stress-Free, Safe & Enriching

A **small group tour in Iceland** is ideal for those who seek comfort and local knowledge without the responsibility of driving. These guided experiences accommodate up to 19 guests, typically aboard premium minibuses like Mercedes Sprinters, and offer a perfect blend of structure and storytelling.

While larger groups of up to 60 people exist at a lower cost, smaller tours strike a balance between affordability and a more intimate experience. You’ll be led by a knowledgeable local guide, and everything—from logistics to safety—is handled for you.

This is a fantastic choice for travelers who want to delve into Icelandic culture and nature without the premium of a private tour.
