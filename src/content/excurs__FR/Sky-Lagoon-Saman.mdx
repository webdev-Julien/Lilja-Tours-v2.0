Step into serenity just minutes from downtown Reykjavík with the Sky Lagoon Pure pass, Iceland’s breathtaking new geothermal spa. Carved into a dramatic stretch of the Atlantic coastline, this immersive retreat blends ancient bathing traditions with contemporary Icelandic design.

## A Tranquil World Just Beyond the City

Though only a short drive from Reykjavík, Sky Lagoon feels like another world—one shaped by sea, sky, and geothermal power. This natural oasis pays tribute to Iceland’s age-old bathing rituals, offering a moment of calm in a setting that’s both wild and beautiful.

## The 7-Step Sky Ritual – A Journey of Rejuvenation

At the heart of the Sky Lagoon experience lies the Sky Ritual, a seven-step wellness journey rooted in Icelandic tradition. Designed to relax body and mind, this rejuvenating process includes:

- A warm geothermal soak with ocean views
- A cold plunge to invigorate the senses
- A steam bath infused with Icelandic aromas
- A cleansing body scrub
- A refreshing shower
- A peaceful sauna
- A final soak to seal in serenity

Every guest is invited to take part in this unforgettable ritual, included with all admissions.

## Booking & Cancellation

- Flexible cancellation: Full refund available if cancelled at least 48 hours before your visit.
- Towels included with all passes.

Take time to reconnect—with nature, with Icelandic tradition, and with yourself—at Sky Lagoon, where every visit feels like a return to something essential.
