Embark on an unforgettable journey through Iceland’s famed Golden Circle Small Group Tour with Farm Lunch — a route rich with stunning landscapes, geological marvels, and cultural heritage. From the dramatic rift valley of Þingvellir to erupting geysers, cascading waterfalls, and charming farm stops, this tour offers the perfect mix of nature, history, and local flavor.

## Tour Highlights

### Þingvellir National Park

Walk between two continents at the only place on Earth where the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates visibly drift apart. Þingvellir is also the birthplace of Iceland’s democracy — home to the world's oldest existing parliament.

### Öxarárfoss Waterfall

Hidden within the national park, this serene waterfall provides a peaceful and picturesque setting, framed by lava cliffs and moss-covered rocks.

### Efstidalur Dairy Farm

Step into authentic Icelandic farm life. Meet the cows and enjoy fresh, homemade ice cream and other local dairy treats in a cozy countryside setting.

### Geysir Geothermal Area

Witness the incredible power of nature as Strokkur geyser erupts every few minutes, launching hot water high into the air. The bubbling earth and steaming vents make this area feel alive beneath your feet.

### Gullfoss Waterfall

Stand in awe before one of Iceland’s most iconic waterfalls. Gullfoss thunders down two tiers into a deep canyon, and the mist in the air adds a mystical touch to this breathtaking spectacle.

### Fridheimar Tomato Farm (Lunch Stop)

Dine inside a working greenhouse surrounded by lush tomato vines. This unique experience offers a menu filled with tomato-based dishes — all made from produce grown on-site. _(Lunch not included in the tour price.)_

### Kerið Volcanic Crater

Stroll along the rim of this vivid volcanic crater, where fiery red rocks encircle a striking blue lake. It’s a peaceful yet dramatic landscape that tells the story of Iceland’s volcanic past.
