Begin your journey to the center of the Earth with an unforgettable visit to Vatnshellir Cave, a mysterious 8,000-year-old lava tube nestled beneath the Snæfellsjökull glacier. Just steps from the Purkhólar crater family, this geological marvel is your gateway to Iceland’s volcanic underworld and the literary legend made famous by Jules Verne.

Unlike Verne’s explorers who descended through the glacier's summit, your path begins at Vatnshellir Cave, where real-world geology meets the imagination of classic science fiction.
