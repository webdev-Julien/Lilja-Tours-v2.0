## Tour Highlights

### Kirkjufell Mountain

One of Iceland’s most photographed peaks, Kirkjufell is as iconic as it is beautiful. Framed by waterfalls and reflected in calm waters, this majestic mountain is a must-see.

### Snæfellsjökull Glacier

This glacier-capped volcano is shrouded in mystery and legend — it even inspired Jules Verne’s _Journey to the Center of the Earth_. Even from afar, its serene presence dominates the skyline.

### Berserkjahraun Lava Fields

Wander through ancient lava flows shaped by eruptions and Viking tales. This eerie, moss-covered terrain offers a glimpse into Iceland’s volcanic heart.

### Djupalonssandur Black Sand Beach

Feel the full force of Icelandic nature at this dramatic beach, where ocean waves crash against jagged cliffs and smooth black stones tell stories of shipwrecks past.

### Arnarstapi Fishing Village

Explore this charming coastal village, known for its basalt cliffs, sea arches, and lively birdlife. The walk along the cliffs offers some of the peninsula’s best views.

### Buðarkirkja – The Black Church

This striking wooden church, painted deep black, stands in stark contrast to the surrounding landscape. A quiet, powerful symbol of Iceland’s cultural heritage.

### Ytri Tunga Seal Beach

Visit a golden sand beach famous for its seal colony. If you're lucky, you’ll spot these playful animals lounging on rocks or splashing in the waves.

### Lunch at a Local Horse Farm

Relax and enjoy a hearty, home-cooked Icelandic meal made with fresh, local ingredients. This cozy lunch stop offers both authentic flavors and a glimpse into rural farm life.
