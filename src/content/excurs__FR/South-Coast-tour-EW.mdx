## Discover Iceland’s Wild South – A Journey into Earth’s Raw Beauty

The South Coast of Iceland Small Group Tour is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. It takes you deep into one of Iceland’s most dramatic and awe-inspiring landscapes — where volcanic power meets glacial beauty, and Viking history echoes through the valleys.

From towering waterfalls to ancient ice and haunting black sand shores, this journey is perfect for nature lovers, photography enthusiasts, and adventure seekers alike.

## Tour Highlights

### Seljalandsfoss Waterfall

Stand in awe before this graceful cascade, then take the rare opportunity to walk _behind_ the waterfall for a completely different view of its beauty. A perfect photo moment, raincoat highly recommended!

### Gljúfrabúi Waterfall

Hidden behind a cliff near Seljalandsfoss, Gljúfrabúi is one of Iceland’s best-kept secrets. Venture through a narrow gorge (weather permitting) and uncover this magical waterfall tucked away from the crowds.

### Skógafoss Waterfall

Majestic and thunderous, Skógafoss drops from a height of 60 meters. Climb the staircase for sweeping views from the top, or admire its power from below as mist fills the air.

### Vík í Mýrdal Village

Pause in the quaint village of Vík, set between towering cliffs and black sand beaches. A charming stop for refreshments, souvenirs, or simply soaking in the coastal vibes.

### Reynisfjara Black Sand Beach

Feel the power of the Atlantic at Reynisfjara — a surreal beach famed for its volcanic black sand, striking basalt columns, and the dramatic Reynisdrangar sea stacks just offshore.

### Sólheimajökull Glacier

Get up close to the icy edge of Sólheimajökull, an outlet glacier from Mýrdalsjökull. The textures, colors, and formations of the glacier make this a fascinating stop — no hiking involved, just unforgettable views.
