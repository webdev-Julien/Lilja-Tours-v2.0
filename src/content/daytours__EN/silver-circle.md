These cascades emerge from a lava field, traveling underground for kilometers before bursting through rocks and vegetation, tumbling gracefully into a striking turquoise river.",

Adding to its intrigue is a poignant legend that explains the disappearance of a natural stone bridge that once spanned the river."
