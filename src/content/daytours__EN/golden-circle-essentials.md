### Golden Circle Essentials: Experience Iceland in Just Six Hours

Join our **Golden Circle Essentials Tour** and visit Iceland’s top three attractions: **Þingvellir National Park**, the erupting **Strokkur geyser**, and the stunning **Gullfoss** (_The Golden Falls_).

Perfect for travelers on a tight schedule, this **half-day (six-hour) tour** offers a seamless way to experience Iceland’s natural wonders—ideal for short visits or cruise stopovers.


### Þingvellir National Park

**Þingvellir National Park** is the perfect starting point for your **Golden Circle tour**, offering stunning scenery and rich history.

Founded in 930, it’s home to the world’s first parliament, where Icelandic settlers met annually to shape laws. The parliament remained here until 1798, and in 2004, Þingvellir became a **UNESCO World Heritage Site**.

Beyond history, Þingvellir sits on the **Mid-Atlantic Ridge**, where the Eurasian and North American plates drift apart. It’s the only place on Earth where this rift is visible above sea level. From the **Hákið viewing platform**, you’ll stand on the edge of the American continent.

A short walk through the park leads to **Öxarárfoss**, a scenic waterfall with its own unique history.


### Geysir & Strokkur 

Did you know that all geysers worldwide are named after **Geysir** in Iceland? The word "geyser" originates from the Icelandic verb **"að geysa,"** meaning *to gush*.  

While Geysir itself is now dormant (its last known eruption was in the year **2000**), its neighboring geyser **Strokkur** remains highly active. Strokkur erupts every **5 to 10 minutes**, thrilling visitors with powerful bursts of steaming water.  

Located in the famous **Golden Circle**, Geysir and Strokkur are must-visit natural wonders, showcasing Iceland's geothermal power. Don't miss the chance to witness Strokkur’s spectacular eruptions up close!


### Gullfoss: The Golden Waterfall

Iceland’s famous **Golden Circle** gets its name from **Gullfoss**, the breathtaking **"Golden Waterfall."** While several legends explain its name, your guide will share the fascinating stories during your visit.  

Did you know that Gullfoss was once at risk of disappearing? A proposed **hydropower plant** nearly altered this natural wonder forever. Thankfully, conservation efforts preserved its beauty, allowing visitors to witness its raw power today.  

A must-see on the **Golden Circle**, Gullfoss showcases Iceland’s untamed nature with its thunderous cascades and stunning golden mist.
