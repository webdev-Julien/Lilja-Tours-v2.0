    itiItemStrings: ["The hike to Glymur, Iceland’s second-highest waterfall, is a thrilling adventure through breathtaking landscapes. This moderately challenging trail takes about three hours round trip, with an ascent on the way up and a descent back down. Along the way, we’ll traverse rugged terrain, cross rivers, and take in some of the most spectacular views near Reykjavík.",
    "One of the unique features of this hike is the river crossings. The first river has a log to help with the crossing, though depending on water levels, wading shoes might be necessary. The second crossing, located at the very top of the waterfall, offers no alternative: you’ll have to step directly into the refreshing waters, adding to the adventure!",
    "With its dramatic cliffs, lush valleys, and the stunning sight of Glymur plunging into the canyon below, this might just be the most scenic day hike from Reykjavík. If you’re looking for an unforgettable experience in Iceland’s wild nature, this is it!"
