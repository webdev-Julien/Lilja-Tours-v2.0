Departing from Reykjavík, this small group Golden Circle tour offers a French-speaking guide and a relaxed, friendly atmosphere with no more than 12 participants. It's a full day of immersion into Iceland’s most iconic and geologically significant sites—all located just beyond the gateway to the Highlands.

## What You’ll See:

- Þingvellir National Park: Walk through the rift valley between the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates, one of the only places in the world where this phenomenon is visible above sea level.
- Geysir Geothermal Area: Witness the powerful Strokkur geyser erupting every few minutes in the geothermal field that gave all geysers their name.
- Gullfoss Waterfall: Stand in awe at this thundering two-tiered waterfall, nestled at the edge of the Langjökull Glacier, plunging into a dramatic glacial canyon.
