**Voted the #1 place to visit in the world in 2023 by TimeOut**, Hvammsvík Hot Springs offers an unforgettable geothermal escape just a short bus ride from Reykjavík.

## A Scenic Journey, Just Minutes Away

Leave the buzz of the city behind with a relaxing 45-minute drive through Iceland's dramatic landscapes. Convenient hotel pickups begin 30 minutes before departure, making your journey seamless from the start.

## Nature’s Spa, Shaped by the Tides

What sets Hvammsvík apart is its location on a **1,200-acre private coastal estate**, where the hot springs blend with the ocean in perfect harmony. Some pools rise and fall with the tide, giving visitors a dynamic and ever-changing soaking experience. All this, with the sound of the Atlantic in the background.

## Eight Unique Pools, One Peaceful Retreat

With **eight naturally heated pools**, a steam cave, and serene outdoor lounging areas, Hvammsvík is more than a hot spring—it's a full nature retreat. The facilities combine modern comfort with inspiration drawn from the area's rich history, dating back to the 12th century.

Want to connect with the elements? Try showering under the open sky in our outdoor changing area.

## The Purest Waters—Geothermal Meets Ocean

The hot springs are filled with a blend of **geothermal water from 1,400 meters underground** and **crisp Atlantic seawater**. This continuous natural flow ensures outstanding water quality and a refreshing experience with every dip.

## Taste Iceland at Stormur Bistro & Bar

After your soak, visit our cozy bistro for locally inspired, light dishes. We recommend the seafood soup—a guest favorite—or the revitalizing algae and ginger shot for a true taste of the sea.

## A Place Where Nature Meets Heritage

Hvammsvík isn’t just about relaxation—it's about reconnection. Watch local wildlife including 30+ bird species, wild sheep in the summer, and—if you're lucky—an elusive Arctic Fox. Locals even say elves dwell among the rocks.

The area is also one of the **best places to catch the northern lights** between October and April.

## Deep Roots in Icelandic History

Once discovered by Viking settlers over a millennium ago—recorded in the ancient Landnámabók—Hvammsvík has always been a special place. Its natural harbor, thermal activity, and surrounding beauty made it a prized location even then.
