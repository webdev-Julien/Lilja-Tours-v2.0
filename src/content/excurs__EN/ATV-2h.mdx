## Why Choose the Twin Peaks ATV Tour?

### Double the Peaks, Double the Thrill

This tour is a step up from the classic Reykjavík Peak ride. You'll climb Hafrafell and Úlfarsfell, two distinct mountains offering unforgettable views and fun, varied terrain.

### A Complete Off-Road Experience

From smooth asphalt and lakeside gravel paths to rocky mountain trails and steep inclines, this route covers it all. Whether you're a first-timer or an experienced rider, the changing terrain keeps things exciting from start to finish.

### Million-Dollar Views

Stand above Reykjavík with a 360° view that includes the Reykjanes Peninsula, Viðey Island, Esja, and even Snæfellsjökull glacier on a clear day. These views alone are worth the ride.
