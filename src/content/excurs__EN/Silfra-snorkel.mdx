## Dive into a Unique Underwater World

Experience the thrill of snorkeling between two tectonic plates in Silfra Fissure, located in Thingvellir National Park, Iceland. Silfra is a crack between the North American and Eurasian continental plates, filled with glacial water that has trickled through underground lava rock for over 30 years. This natural filtration results in the clearest water on Earth, offering visibility over 100 meters. Floating through Silfra is a truly otherworldly experience that combines vibrant colors, near-freezing temperatures, and the sensation of flying through crystal-clear water.
