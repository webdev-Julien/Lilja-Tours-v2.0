## High-Speed Whale Watching Adventure in Reykjavík

Feel the thrill of the ocean and witness Iceland’s incredible marine life up close!

Hop aboard our newest RIB (Rigid Inflatable Boat) for a fast-paced, unforgettable 2-hour whale watching tour. This express adventure is perfect for those looking to make the most of their time in Reykjavík while experiencing nature at its wildest.

## Get Closer Than Ever to Whales in Faxaflói Bay

Our specially designed 12-meter boat allows for close encounters with whales in a way that's safe for both you and the wildlife. With a cruising speed of 32 knots, we spend less time getting there and more time where the whales are feeding.

## Puffins, Speed, and Coastal Views

During the summer months, we make a stop at Akurey, also known as Puffin Island, to see these charismatic seabirds in their natural nesting grounds. Afterward, we zoom across the bay, feeling the sea breeze and excitement build. On our return, enjoy a scenic ride along the beautiful Reykjavík coastline — a fantastic moment to snap some photos of the city from the sea.

## Bonus: Free Entry to Whales of Iceland

Every RIB Express ticket includes free admission to the Whales of Iceland Exhibition, located nearby in the harbor area. We highly recommend visiting before or after your tour to enrich your whale watching experience.
