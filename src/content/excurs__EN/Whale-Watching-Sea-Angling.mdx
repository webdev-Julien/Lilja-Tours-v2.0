## Whale Watching & Sea Angling Combo Tour in Reykjavík

Witness the magic of marine wildlife, then cast your line for a hands-on fishing experience—topped off with a taste of your fresh catch!

This two-part sea adventure combines the thrill of whale watching with the serenity and tradition of sea angling. Whether you're looking for excitement, relaxation, or a bit of both, this tour offers a memorable experience on the waters of Faxaflói Bay.

## Start with Whale Watching in the Wild

Begin your journey out at sea, scanning the horizon for Minke whales, Humpbacks, White-beaked dolphins, and Harbour porpoises. These waters are teeming with life, and you might even spot dolphins surfing alongside the boat or curious whales swimming close to the surface.

Choose between two unique whale watching options:

- 13:00 CLASSIC Tour – A comfortable, educational cruise ideal for families and those who enjoy a slower pace. Features spacious decks and a cozy onboard cafeteria.
- 14:00 EXPRESS Tour – A faster, more dynamic boat ride that gets you to the whale-watching grounds quickly while still giving you ample time to enjoy the wildlife.

Both tours return to Reykjavík between 16:00 and 16:30, just in time for your fishing adventure!

## Then Switch Gears for a Sea Angling Experience

At 17:00, board our fishing vessel, _Rósin_, for a traditional Icelandic sea angling tour. Cast your line and try your luck at catching cod, haddock, or pollock. No experience? No problem! This tour is suitable for all ages and skill levels, and our crew will guide you every step of the way.

The best part? Your catch is grilled on board and served with potatoes and sauce—a delicious end to your day at sea.
