## Whales of Iceland: Europe’s Largest Whale Museum in Reykjavík

Step into the underwater world of giants and discover the majestic whales of Iceland like never before!

At Whales of Iceland, you’ll come face to face with over 25 life-sized models of the incredible marine mammals that have roamed Icelandic waters throughout history. With immersive soundscapes, hands-on exhibits, and detailed information displays, this one-of-a-kind museum is a must-see for wildlife lovers, families, and curious minds of all ages.

## See 23 Whale Species — Up Close and Life-Sized

From the awe-inspiring blue whale to the elusive North Atlantic right whale, each model is built to scale and crafted with care. Every whale is based on real individuals observed in the wild — complete with unique markings, hand-painted finishes, and soft textures you can touch and explore.

## A Fully Immersive, Interactive Experience

The museum goes beyond the visual. Enjoy ambient lighting, soothing underwater sounds, and fascinating facts at every turn. Dive into the conservation zone created in collaboration with the International Fund for Animal Welfare, where you'll learn about five major threats whales face today — and how we can make a difference.

## Award-Winning Documentaries & Guided Tours

Watch stunning whale footage and insightful documentaries in the Fin Whale Theatre, included with your ticket. Live expert-led tours run daily at 11:00 and 15:00, offering even deeper insight into the whales’ lives and behaviors.

## New: Become a Whale Researcher!

Explore the newest addition to the museum — a research exhibit where you can engage with real science. Thanks to a partnership with Zooniverse, you’ll even get a chance to participate in ongoing whale research and become a citizen scientist.
