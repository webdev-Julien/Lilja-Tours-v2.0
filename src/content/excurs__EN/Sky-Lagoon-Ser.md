Unwind just minutes from Reykjavík in a place that feels worlds away with the Sky Lagoon Sky pass. **Sky Lagoon**, Iceland’s newest geothermal retreat, invites you to soak in serenity while gazing across the North Atlantic. Perched on a dramatic coastline, this oceanside oasis blends modern design with deep-rooted Icelandic bathing traditions.

## Where Sea Meets Sky – And Wellness Begins

Sky Lagoon is more than a spa—it's a return to the elements. Here, the time-honored ritual of geothermal bathing is reborn through a powerful connection to nature. Inspired by centuries of Icelandic tradition, the experience reflects the harmony between sea, sky, and volcanic energy beneath the surface.

## The Sky Ritual – A Seven-Step Journey to Renewal

At the heart of every visit is the **Sky Ritual**: a transformative wellness circuit designed to refresh and restore. Guided by Icelandic tradition, this seven-step ritual includes:

1. A warm soak in the geothermal lagoon
2. A cold plunge to awaken the body
3. A relaxing steam room experience
4. A purifying body scrub
5. A refreshing shower
6. A soothing sauna with ocean views
7. A final peaceful dip in the lagoon

This full ritual is **included with all admissions**.
