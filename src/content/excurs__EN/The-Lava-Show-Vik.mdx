In the Lava Show in Vík, you can stand just a few feet away from red-hot, flowing lava in a safe and controlled environment. As the world’s only live lava show, it’s a truly unique and unforgettable experience that offers a rare chance to see, hear, smell, and feel molten lava up close.

### Why Visit LAVA SHOW Vík?

If you’re fascinated by volcanoes, geology, and the raw power of nature, this is an absolute must-see. Located in the charming town of Vík, the show recreates a miniature volcanic eruption by superheating real lava from the 1918 Katla eruption and pouring it into the showroom. The temperature soars as the lava flows, but you’ll be safely seated just a few feet away, fully immersed in the experience.

## An Educational and Thrilling Performance

The show kicks off with a warm welcome from the host, followed by a short educational video about Icelandic volcanism, focusing on the Katla volcano and its historical impact. The host also shares a personal story and discusses the emergency plan if Katla were to erupt.

When the lava starts flowing, the excitement reaches a peak. The host interacts with the molten rock, using an iron rod to shape it, forming Pele’s hair, lava tunnels, and caves while explaining the fascinating science behind these formations. The intense heat, glow, and crackling sounds create an atmosphere that is both mesmerizing and educational.

### Playing with Lava: A Rare Opportunity

The host literally plays with the lava right before your eyes! They manipulate the molten rock to create unique shapes, explaining each formation and answering questions from the audience. The experience is both intimate and interactive, leaving visitors in awe of nature’s raw power.
