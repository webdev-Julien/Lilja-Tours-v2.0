### Geysir: The birthplace of all geysers  

The word **"geyser"** comes from **Geysir**, Iceland’s legendary hot spring. Derived from the Icelandic term **"að geysa"** (meaning *to gush*) Geysir was once a powerful force of nature.  

However, Geysir has been **dormant** since **2000**, leaving the spotlight to its smaller but highly active neighbor, **Strokkur**. Erupting every **5 to 10 minutes**, Strokkur sends scalding water skyward, mesmerizing onlookers.  

A highlight of the **Golden Circle**, this geothermal wonder remains a must-visit destination. Experience the thrill of Iceland’s volcanic power with Strokkur’s dramatic eruptions!
