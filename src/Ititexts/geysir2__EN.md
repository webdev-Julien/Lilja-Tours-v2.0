### Geysir: The geyser that named them all  

The famous **Geysir** in Iceland is the namesake of all geysers worldwide. The term "geyser" originates from the Icelandic word **"að geysa,"** meaning *to gush*.  

Though Geysir is now **dormant**—with its last eruption recorded in **2000**—another spectacular geyser, **Strokkur**, remains highly active. Strokkur erupts every **5 to 10 minutes**, shooting steaming water high into the sky.  

Located in Iceland’s **Golden Circle**, this geothermal marvel attracts visitors from all over the world. Witness nature’s raw power as Strokkur puts on a breathtaking show!
