### Þingvellir National Park

<!--The **Þingvellir National Park** is the best place to start this tour on the **Golden Circle**. The park stuns both by its beauty and history. 

In fact, this is where was founded the very first parliament in the world, in 930. The Icelandic settlers, used to convene here once a year to discuss the laws of Iceland and pass them between the different settlements. The parliament was located in Þingvellir until 1798 and became **World Heritage in 2004**.

But this fascinating history is not the only reason to enjoy your visit of **Þingvellir National Park**. As you may know, Iceland is being **torn by two diverging tectonic plates**: The Eurasian plate and the North-American plate. This division is called the North-Atlantic ridge and runs under the ocean. There is only one place on earth where you can see it above sea level: in **Þingvellir**. As you will be standing on the viewing platform of Hákið, you will be literrally standing on the edge of the american continent.

Later, after a short walk through the park, we will visit the waterfall: **Öxarárfoss**, which also has an interesting story.-->

**Þingvellir National Park** is the perfect starting point for your **Golden Circle tour**, offering stunning scenery and rich history.

Founded in 930, it’s home to the world’s first parliament, where Icelandic settlers met annually to shape laws. The parliament remained here until 1798, and in 2004, Þingvellir became a **UNESCO World Heritage Site**.

Beyond history, Þingvellir sits on the **Mid-Atlantic Ridge**, where the Eurasian and North American plates drift apart. It’s the only place on Earth where this rift is visible above sea level. From the **Hákið viewing platform**, you’ll stand on the edge of the American continent.

A short walk through the park leads to **Öxarárfoss**, a scenic waterfall with its own unique history.
