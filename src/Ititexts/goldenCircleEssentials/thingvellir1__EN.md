### Þingvellir National Park

**Þingvellir National Park** is the perfect starting point for your **Golden Circle tour**, offering stunning scenery and rich history.

Founded in 930, it’s home to the world’s first parliament, where Icelandic settlers met annually to shape laws. The parliament remained here until 1798, and in 2004, Þingvellir became a **UNESCO World Heritage Site**.

Beyond history, Þingvellir sits on the **Mid-Atlantic Ridge**, where the Eurasian and North American plates drift apart. It’s the only place on Earth where this rift is visible above sea level. From the **Hákið viewing platform**, you’ll stand on the edge of the American continent.

A short walk through the park leads to **Öxarárfoss**, a scenic waterfall with its own unique history.
