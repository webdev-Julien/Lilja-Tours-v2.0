### Geysir and Strokkur

Geysir gave its name to all the geysers in the world. This is where the word "Geyser" originates from. Geysir comes from the Icelandic "AÃ° geysa" which means: To gush.

But Geysir is nowadays dormant. It came out of the ground for the last time in the year 2000. Its little brotherStrokkur, is still very active, and erupting every 5 to 10 minutes on average.
