### Þingvellir National Park

is the perfect place to start this tour. It is of high interest, both historically and geologically.

While in Þingvellir, you will find yourself at the exact place where was founded the very first parliament in the World, back in the year 930.

Not to mention that the North Atlantic ridge, which is the separation between the North American and the Eurasian tectonic plates, can be seen in only one place in the world: right under your feet. When standing on the viewing platform, you are literally standing on the very edge of the American continent.
